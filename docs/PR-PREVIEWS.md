# Per-PR website previews

Every pull request to the content repo (`ARENA-education/ARENA_materials`) that
changes a page of this site gets its own rendered copy of that page, with a
side-by-side **diff vs main** view:

```
https://learn.arena.education/pr-preview/pr-<N>/
```

A bot comments that URL on the PR. The idea and the diff view are ported from
[iliad-team/iliad-intensive](https://github.com/iliad-team/iliad-intensive)
(`docs/PR-PREVIEWS.md`, `public/diff.js`); the plumbing is different because
the two sites are built differently.

## How it works

ILIAD's site is a static export, so a preview there is a second build of the
whole site under a path prefix. This site is not built at all: it fetches
markdown from the content repo at request time and renders it. So a preview
here is **the same app, rendering the same URL from different markdown** — no
second deploy, no build step.

The catch is *which* markdown. A content PR edits master files
(`infrastructure/chapters/**/master_*.py`); the pages this site renders
(`chapterX/instructions/pages/*.md`) are regenerated from them only after
merge. A PR's own branch therefore still holds the old pages. Two halves:

**Content repo** (`.github/workflows/` there, documented in its own
`.github/PR-PREVIEWS.md`): the PR check already regenerates the changed sections;
it now uploads the regenerated pages, and a second workflow copies them to a
`pr-preview` branch:

```
pr-preview branch
  pr-407/preview.json                                  {pr, title, head_sha, pages: [...], notebooks: [...]}
  pr-407/chapter0_fundamentals/instructions/pages/03_[0.3]_Optimization.md
  pr-407/chapter0_fundamentals/exercises/part3_optimization/0.3_Optimization_exercises.ipynb
  pr-407/chapter0_fundamentals/exercises/part3_optimization/tests.py
  pr-412/...
```

**This repo**:

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| `/pr-preview/pr-<N>/…` routes — the chapter pages and the section API again, with a `pr` argument | `pages/urls.py` |
| `_get_preview()` reads `pr-<N>/preview.json` (404 → no such preview); `_fetch_content()` serves a page from the preview if the manifest lists it, otherwise from main as usual | `pages/views.py` |
| `_preview_colab_links()` points the Colab links of the notebooks the manifest lists at the PR's copies | `pages/views.py` |
| `preview_index` — landing page listing the pages the PR changes | `pages/views.py`, `templates/preview_index.html` |
| Banner, `noindex`, `window.ARENA_BASE_PATH`; `{{ base_path }}` on in-site links so navigation stays inside the preview | `templates/base.html`, `templates/chapter.html` |
| `BASE_PATH` on the URLs chapter-nav builds, and an `arena:content-rendered` event after each client-side render | `static/js/chapter-nav.js` |
| The diff view | `static/js/diff.js`, end of `static/css/style.css` |

Outside `/pr-preview/` none of it is active: `base_path` renders as an empty
string, and the banner, the script tag and `diff.js` itself are only emitted
when the view passes a `preview`.

### The diff view

Tick **diff vs main** in the banner. `diff.js` fetches the current section
from the section API twice — `/pr-preview/pr-<N>/api/<chapter>/<section>/` and
`/api/<chapter>/<section>/` — and takes the current subsection from each. Both
are this origin and both return rendered HTML, so there is nothing to scrape.

From there it is ILIAD's algorithm unchanged: split both articles into leaf
blocks, sequence-diff them (LCS), pair removed+added blocks that share enough
words into edits with word-level marks inside (an inline formula is one
token; KaTeX's MathML annotation supplies the TeX source), then pad matched
blocks into shared rows so the two columns scroll together. Solutions
(`<details>`) that contain a change are opened. **sync scroll** off gives each
column its own scrollbar.

The site navigates client-side, so the view listens for
`arena:content-rendered` and rebuilds itself for each subsection. The status
readout (`−1 +4 ~1 blocks`) is per subsection; a subsection that does not
exist on main reports "subsection is new on this PR".

### Colab links

A page's Colab links open the notebooks on main, which do not have the PR's
changes: like the pages, notebooks are regenerated only after merge. So the
content repo publishes the PR's notebooks next to its pages and lists them in
the manifest's `notebooks`. Inside a preview, a link to a listed notebook

```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/<owner>/<repo>/blob/main/<path>.ipynb?t=20260928
```

is rewritten in the markdown, before rendering, to

```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/<owner>/<repo>/blob/pr-preview/pr-<N>/<path>.ipynb?t=<head sha>
```

Links to notebooks the PR did not regenerate are left alone, as is every link
when the manifest has no `notebooks` (a preview published before this
existed). The `?t=` is there because Colab keeps a copy of a notebook it has
opened; the PR's head commit makes each push a new URL.

The published notebooks are not main's with a different URL: each has a
banner cell, and a cell after the setup cell that fetches the PR's exercise
files. That is the content repo's doing, see its `.github/PR-PREVIEWS.md`.
The diff view compares text, so the rewritten links do not show up in it.

## Configuration

Nothing is required in production: previews are read from the `pr-preview`
branch of the repo that `GH_OWNER` / `GH_REPO` already name.

| Env var | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `PR_PREVIEW_BRANCH` | `pr-preview` | branch of the content repo holding previews |
| `PR_PREVIEW_RAW_BASE` | *(unset)* | full base URL to read previews from instead, e.g. a local server |

### Trying it locally

Serve a fake `pr-preview` branch and point the app at it:

```sh
mkdir -p fake/pr-1/chapter0_fundamentals/instructions/pages
# ...put an edited copy of a page in there, plus fake/pr-1/preview.json:
#   {"pr": 1, "title": "test", "pages": ["chapter0_fundamentals/instructions/pages/01_[0.1]_Ray_Tracing.md"]}
python3 -m http.server 8901 --directory fake &
PR_PREVIEW_RAW_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8901 python3 manage.py runserver
# open http://127.0.0.1:8000/pr-preview/pr-1/
```

`http.server` sends `.md` without a charset, which turns non-ASCII text into
mojibake (GitHub sends UTF-8); if that matters, serve with
`Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`.

Tests: `python3 manage.py test pages`.

## Security

A preview is PR-author-controlled markdown — which may contain raw HTML —
rendered on this site's origin. That is why the app reads previews **only**
from the `pr-preview` branch, which only the content repo's workflow writes,
and only for authors it trusts (members and collaborators, or any PR a
maintainer has given the `preview` label). Do not "simplify" this to reading `refs/pull/<N>/head`
directly: raw.githubusercontent.com does serve it, but that would render
markdown from anyone who opens a PR.

PR titles reach the page through Django's autoescaping; keep them out of
`|safe`.

A previewed notebook is the PR author's code, run by whoever opens it, in
their own Colab session. It is published under the same gate as the pages,
and the Colab links are only ever rewritten to the `pr-preview` branch of the
content repo, never to a fork.

## Known limitations

- **The chapter list comes from main.** `config.yaml` is not previewed, so a PR
  that adds, renames or reorders sections shows main's navigation.
- **Only the pages and the Colab links.** The right sidebar's download /
  copy-context / chat features read `/api/raw/…`, i.e. main's files, even
  inside a preview.
- **Freshness.** raw.githubusercontent.com caches for about five minutes, and
  this app's responses carry `max-age=300`; a push can take that long to show.
- **Blocks are matched by content**, so inserting an exercise mid-section shows
  later renumbered headings as edited (true, but noisy). A solution with a
  removed sentence opens on the left only.
- **Alignment is measured, not computed**: a very late-loading image can leave
  a few px of drift; there is a second pass after 1.5 s.
